<h1>Homework 6: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Brooke Kongmany</h2>
<h3>This choropleth map divides the state of Pennsylvania into counties and is colored based on the estimated median household income in dollars. As we can see on the map, the highest estimated median household income is located in the bottom right corner of the state and partially on the lower left side. These areas of high income are clustered around the two major cities in Pennsylvania: Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.  </h3>
