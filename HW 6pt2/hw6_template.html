<h1>Homework 6pt2: Census Data Ratios and Categories </h1>
<h2>Brooke Kongmany</h2>
<h3>These choropleth maps divide the state of Pennsylvania into counties and is colored and categorized based on the ratio of Owner Occupied Housing and Total Housing. The Equal Interval Map divides the information into equal class sizes and, in this case, into 5 seperate classes. Although this way of categorizing data is simple and easy to understand it does not weight the different classes seperately and can be an inaccurate representation of the data. The Quantile or Equal Count Map divides more so based on weight rather than equally like the previous example. This is helpful in providing a more accurate picture of the data but again, has its pros and cons. The last map, the Natural Breaks Map, classifies the data based on what the system thinks is the best way to "breakup" the data. This helps divide the data into specific classes based on thier values so if there is more variation in the data then it will categorize them accordingly. All of these ways of categorizing our data has its pros and cons and will depend on what type of information you want to highlight. </h3>
