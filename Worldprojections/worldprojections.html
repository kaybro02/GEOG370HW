    <h1>GEOG 370 Homework 3: Projections</h1>
    
    <p style="color:rgb(23, 98, 105)">I created these maps by changing the "Coordinate Reference System" tool used on QGIS. I also added the Tissot circles by installing the "Indicatrix Mapper" plugin. Using these tools, I have been able to export these maps in various projections and make observations based on them. </p>
    
    <h2>3857 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is one of the most commonly used projections known as the Pseudo-Mercator projection. This projection is commonly used in everyday life and is the one that many of us are familiar with. This projection distorts area towards the poles but preserves things like relative distance, direction, and shape. </h3>

    <h2>53018 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is the Sphere Winkel projection. This cylindrical projection is also commonly used as it preserves shape, distance, and direction. Although the area does get distorted a but around the poles, it is not as bad as other map distortions.  </h3>

    <h2>54034 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is a cylindrical equal area projection. As the name implies, this projection does preserve area much better than other projections however the general shape of the countries, especailly towards the poles, does appear to be distorted. However, the distance and general direction between countries is preserved. </h3>

    <h2>54027 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is the Equidistant Conic projection. This projection is very interesting to observe as it is not one that is commonly used today. This conic projection distorts direction but it does preserve a fair amount of distance between the countries.  </h3>

    <h2>102016 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is the North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant projection. This projeciton is very similar to the previous Equidistant Conic projection as it is another conic projection of the world. This one, however, appears to be more stretched out into a complete circle. Like the previous projection, it does preserve distance but distorts area, shape, and direction.  </h3>

    <h2>Additional Projection (54021)</h2>
    <h3>This projection is a polyconic projection that was created using a combination of multiple conic projections. Although the shape is preserved, the area for these countries is not. The direction and the distance area also very distorted. Dispite this, this map is very intreguing to observe as it is not one that we typically see being used.  </h3>

    <h2>Additional Projection (54009)</h2>
    <h3>This projection is also known as the World Mollweide projection. It is a cylindrical projection that appears to have very slight distortions in shape as you look towards the poles. Although it does distort shape and area, it also preserves general direction. This projection is very similar to the Sphere Winkel projection but it appears to be more stretched out into an oval shape in comparison. </h3>
