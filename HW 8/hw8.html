    <p>When creating this map it is very difficult to come up with a precise number to that question. As we can see though, fast food restaurants and major roadways are in very close proximity as shown by the high amounts of intersection on the map. I created this map by putting a buffer around both the fast food restaurants and around the Georgia highway data that I had. I then intersected the two buffers to show just how close these restaurants are to these roadways. This makes sense because we are a car-dominated society and we rely on our cars to get everywhere we need to go. In places outside of Atlanta, Georgia, there are practically no fast food restaurants that exist if not beside a major roadway.</p>
